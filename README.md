## Spend Jeff Bezos Money

This is just a simple website built with React where you can pretty much see how much stuff you can buy using Jeff Bezos' net worth.
Okay, okay, I get it, you might be thinking: "Aight, but what's the point of this?" **None**; there's no point. I was just bored and said: "You know what? Let's build this 'cuz why not?"
