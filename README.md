## Spend Jeff Bezos Money - [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/germmand/spend-jeff-bezos-money.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/germmand/spend-jeff-bezos-money)

This is just a simple website built with React where you can pretty much see how much stuff you can buy using Jeff Bezos' net worth.

Okay, okay, I get it, you might be thinking: 
> Aight, but what's the point of this? 

And the truth is: **None**; there's no point. I was just bored and said: 
> You know what? Let's build this 'cuz why not? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
